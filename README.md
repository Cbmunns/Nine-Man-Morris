# Nine-Man-Morris

Tkinter board, has mapped coordinated and a board drawn out. Has optional menu with buttons that click, but don't load board quite yet. Will probably need to make 
the circle/elipses into buttons to click for player placements. I thought creating a list for the positions and a separate list for keeping track of the moves
(similar to the tic tac toe logic). For AI, random moves may be benificial at first, I was thinking minimax eventually. 

Tic tac toe, made with pygame as a template for possible usage. Pygame makes tracking mouse clicks really easy, as well as moving from screens. Can't draw as well
as tkinter, but that may not be an issue once we have our board flushed out. Menus are also pretty easy. Right now the random mode is a bit messy, adds multiple pieces
after each loop, and doesnt let the computer finish properly, but the human v human function works great with some input checks as well. Can explain in more detail
if needed!
